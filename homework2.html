    <h1>Adobo</h1>
    <p>
      Adobo is often made using meat (chicken, pork, or beef) marinated in
      vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and other spices. The meat is cooked gently
      until it is soft and delicious. Adobo is a popular rice-based meal in many
      Filipino families.

    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>⅔ cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How to cook:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook
        chicken pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer
        chicken to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown,
        about 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black
        pepper, and bay leaf.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil.
        Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and
        cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- what should smell -->
    <p>
      The house would smell of garlic, vinegar and soy sauce. My brother would
      relish the last bits of brown, soy sauce and smear it over white rice.
